# Structure

For easy read, each step is detailed before the code as a comment.
1. Starting the code by importing librairies for data exploration and analysis and appropriate file
2. Exploration of the file
3. Filtering dataframe and selecting columns to create the subset we want to analyse
4. Cleaning columns' name format and empty rows
5. Cleaning columns' values using various cleaning techniques and creating relevant columns
6. Importing libraries for data visualisation
7. Creating of various "groupby" and filtered tables as well as charts in order to support our hypothesis and get insights
